# PDF Question-Answering Application

This is a full-stack application that allows users to upload PDF files, ask questions related to the content, and receive accurate answers. Built with FastAPI, LangChain or LlamaIndex, React.js, AWS S3, and PyMuPDF, this app uses a FastAPI backend for PDF handling and question-answering functionalities, and a Vite-powered React frontend.

## Project Structure

- **Frontend:** React.js (Vite) serves the user interface for PDF upload and question-answering.
- **Backend:** FastAPI with LangChain/LlamaIndex for processing PDFs and answering questions.
- **Database:** SQLite or PostgreSQL (configurable) for persistent storage.
- **File Storage:** AWS S3 for PDF storage and retrieval.

## Features

### Core Features
- **PDF Upload**: Upload PDFs to be stored securely on AWS S3.
- **Question-Answering**: Ask questions related to any uploaded PDF document, with responses generated from the document's content.
- **Persistent Storage**: Track uploaded files and questions in a database.

### Additional Features
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling across both frontend and backend.
- **Enhanced Instructions**: Guided steps on the frontend for a smooth user experience.
- **File Validation**: Validates file format and size before upload.
- **Error Logs**: Backend logs with timestamped error records.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Caching for repeated questions.

## Setup Guide

### Prerequisites
1. **AWS Account**: For S3 storage.
2. **Python**: Version 3.9 or above.
3. **Node.js**: For frontend development and Vite.
4. **Docker** (optional): If deploying using Docker.

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pdf-question-answering-app.git
   cd pdf-question-answering-app
   ```

2. **Backend Setup**
   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
     ```
   - **Configure Environment Variables**
     Set up the `.env` file with AWS and database configurations.

     ```plaintext
     AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
     AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
     AWS_S3_BUCKET=your-s3-bucket-name
     DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./database.db
     ```

   - Run backend server:
     ```bash
     uvicorn backend.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
     ```

3. **Frontend Setup**
   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     npm install
     ```
   - Start the frontend server:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```

## Usage Guide (Frontend)

1. **Upload any PDF**: Select the PDF you want to upload.
2. **Click Upload**: Uploads the selected PDF to the server.
3. **Copy the uploaded PDF's name**: This name will be needed for querying.
4. **Paste into file name input**: Enter the file name exactly as it appears.
5. **Enter your question**: Type the question related to the PDF content.
6. **Click Ask Question**: Sends your question and retrieves an answer.

## Error Handling

### Frontend

- **File Upload**: Validates if the file is a PDF and checks file size.
- **Network Issues**: Displays error message if backend is unreachable.
- **Invalid Input**: Prompts users if mandatory fields are left empty.
- **Response Errors**: Catches server errors and displays user-friendly messages.

### Backend

- **PDF Validation**: Ensures only PDFs are processed.
- **File Not Found**: Returns error if file is not in S3.
- **Database Errors**: Catches SQL errors with proper logging.
- **General Exceptions**: Logs unexpected errors with timestamps and details.

## Deployment on AWS EC2 (Optional)

1. **Install Docker** on your EC2 instance.
2. **Build Backend and Frontend Images**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t pdf-backend ./backend
   docker build -t pdf-frontend ./frontend
   ```
3. **Run Containers**:
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 8000:8000 pdf-backend
   docker run -d -p 3000:3000 pdf-frontend
   ```

## Additional Improvements

- **Optimized Caching**: Improves speed for repeated questions.
- **Enhanced Security**: Sanitizes inputs to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.
- **User Sessions**: Added support for storing recent activities.
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Maintains logs with traceability for issues.
